Let me put it this way.

Little Timmy works full-time in St. Catharines, earns close to minimum wage, pays his rent on time, and figures homeownership is something for “someday.” On paper, it doesn’t look glamorous.

But what if I told you Timmy has decent credit, a bit of savings, and an uncle willing to co-sign?

Add Ontario’s first-time buyer programs, an insured mortgage, and a lender who understands how these files are structured — and suddenly Timmy isn’t dreaming anymore. He’s looking at real options.

We look at each situation individually and map the smartest path forward.
